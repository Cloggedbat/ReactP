            MY MISSION:
        </p>
          <p>Over the last year, my partner and I have moved across the country to Utah and have fallen in love with this
          state. With the recent outbreak of COVID-19, my focus has shifted from working in the ski industry to looking
          at the future of our post-pandemic economy. This will be an economy that has elevated e-commerce and marketing
        to new levels, as brick and mortars become liabilities for small local businesses.</p>
          <p>I have a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Saint Michael's College in Colchester, VT. Over the last
          winter I worked at Ski Butlers in Park City as a Team Leader; I was in charge of our 5 to 10 ski technicians
          who would be out delivering our equipment while handling any client issues and calls. This job allowed me to
        quickly understand Utah and my future in this state.</p>
          <p>Prior to our transition to Utah, I worked with a talented team at Stowe Cider, creating one of the finest
          hard ciders on the east coast. During my time with them, I was tasked with managing our inbound orders from
          distributors to the outbound product leaving the warehouse. As Stowe Ciderâ€™s lone Sales Representative at the
          time, I oversaw a 13% growth in our Burlington market, 9% in Vermont, and 13% in our New England market. This
          was accomplished though creating good relations with new accounts and managing existing relationships. I am
          also well versed in communicating with any customer while at sales demonstrations, trade shows, or any other
        event.</p>
